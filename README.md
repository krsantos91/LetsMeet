<h3>Description</h3>
A user begins by created a group, designating a name for it as well as specifying the number of people expected to participate in the session. A randomized sitekey is then generated that can be shared in order to grant access to other users as a form a authentication. As users enter their location, the application generates the geographical midpoint between all the users when the room is full, and returns set of locations within a specified radius of that midpoint. Users then can suggest a time and location to meet at, to which all the users must agree to. Users can also communicate with each other using the chatroom. By using firebase, we are able to have all browser pages conencted to a single session dynamically change as the database is updated with information, giving the web application a very interactive feel.
